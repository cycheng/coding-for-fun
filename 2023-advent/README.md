* Day5, range intersection
* Day10, interesting maze problem. like.
* Day12, DP, LCS. like.
* Day13: Bad description, I don't like it.
* Day16: Ok.
* Day17: priority queue
  * unordered_set with custom hash
* Day18: Shoelace formula
* Day19: range splitting
* Day20: hard. circuit question.
* Day21: hard. mathematics puzzle.
* Day22: range intersection (stack boxes). topological sort.
  I made some mistakes in mapping Brick and Support, so to simplify, I just use
  unordered_map with Pos id.
  * Please refactoring if have time!
  * the second problem a bit like an union problem?
* Day23: graph traversal.
  * todo: Think how to reduce the graph complexity.
